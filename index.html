        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Dire Wolf was living around Earth's last ice age.Excitingly it is good to know that they even roamed around North America. Another Name for the Dire Wolf is Canis dirus.They were bigger than our wolf that we see on national geographic. A reason they were bigeer is mainly because of their bone size. The DIre Wolf lived for more than 100,000 years,but went extinct about 10,000 years ago.During this time the Gray wolf began its evolution toward what it is today in which the Dire Wolf did not is what is believed.</p>

	       		<h3>Facts About the Dire wolf</h3>
	      		<p>Since the Dire Wolf wass no longer living when technology began to improve scientist sometimes struggle to understand their life and habits. Luckily, their are fossils found in certain areas that help us understand them. These fossils prove to us that the Dire Wolf was not as smart as the wolves we have today, but they were bigger and stronger to make up for this lost in brain. A location for them to rome around was  SOCAL'S LA BREA tar pits which used to be a trap for prey for predators. They weren't the only big predator their though. They had to co-exist with the saber-toothed tiger at these big places for prey. To get an idea of what they ate think about a giant wolf taking down a horse with a vicious bite.</p>
